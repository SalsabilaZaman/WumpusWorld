# Wumpus World Logical Agent

## Overview

This project simulates the navigation of a logical agent in the Wumpus World environment using logical representation and inference techniques. It is developed as part of the **CSE 604: Artificial Intelligence** course to explore how intelligent agents can reason and make decisions in uncertain and dangerous environments.

The Wumpus World is a grid-based environment inspired by Section 7.2 of Russell and Norvigâ€™s AI textbook, where an agent must locate gold while avoiding deadly pits and the Wumpus creature. Our implementation uses a **10x10 grid** instead of the original smaller layout to enhance complexity and depth.

## Features

- âœ… Logical reasoning using **Propositional Logic** or **First Order Logic (FOL)**
- âœ… Flexible loading of environments: both **randomly generated** and **pre-defined maps**
- âœ… Representation of the environment and agent's knowledge base
- âœ… Inference mechanisms: **resolution**, **forward chaining**, **backward chaining**
- âœ… Optional integration of **probabilistic reasoning**
- âœ… **Loop detection and avoidance** to prevent infinite traversal
- âœ… Interactive UI to visualize:
  - Agent's actions and decisions
  - Internal knowledge base
  - Logical reasoning process
